welcome_text = Welcome to Best Travel Project. I learnt from Google that Internationalization is the process by which \
  I can make my web application to use all languages. I want to understand Unicode for the process of \
  internationalization, so I learnt about Unicode from here  and there. I am able to understand about Unicode that \
  how a charset set in encoded to bytes and again bytes decoded to charset. But I don't know how to move forward further. \
  I want to learn how to compare strings and I need to know how to implement internationalization in my web application. \
  Any Suggestions Please? Please guide me.
